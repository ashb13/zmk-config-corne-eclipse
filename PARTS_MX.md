| ✅ | 2 | [Reset Switches](https://splitkb.com/products/reset-buttons) | Tactile SMD reset switches. |
| ❌ | 1-2 | [nice!view Display](https://nicekeyboards.com/nice-view/) | The left is the most important, as it shows active bluetooth state and profile. Be sure to get pins/sockets that accomodate your socketing height of the nice!nano. |
| ❌ | 1-2 | [Alps EC11 Rotary Encoder](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Alps-Alpine/EC11N1524402?qs=W%2FMpXkg%252BdQ5mmk2EdvtXAA%3D%3D) | Alps Alpine EC11N1524402 or EC11 compatible encoder. |
| ❌ | 1 | [Azoteq TPS43 Touchpad Module](https://holykeebs.com/products/touchpad-module) | Replaces the right encoder. Requires 5 wires (SDA, SCL, RDY, VCC, GND) to the nice!nano. See [wiring guide](WIRING_TRACKPAD.md). |

## Hardware

I haven't yet verified the exact screws, so this list may not be exact. YMMV.

| Required | Quantity | Part | Notes |
|----------|---------|------|-------|

## Fabrication

While the sections above cover items you can buy, this section documents
what needs to be created.

The circuit board, plates, and shields need to be fabricated by a PCB and 3D
printing company like [Elecrow](https://www.elecrow.com/),
[JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/), [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/), or
[OSHPark](https://oshpark.com/). I've had good work from Elecrow in the past.

### Circuit Board

![Circuit Board](/assets/images/corne-eclipse-kicad-circuitboard.png)

Some vendors won't render the outside negative space of the circuitboard
correctly in their uploader tool, but it is still fine.

Provide these files to the fabricator:
- [corne-eclipse-circuitboard.zip](/fabrication/!for-fabricator-production/corne-eclipse-circuitboard.zip)

### Plates

![Plates](/assets/images/corne-eclipse-kicad-plates.png)

This will need to be cut the same way that circuitboards are. There may be an
extra charge for adding break-away points to the plate print.

Provide these files to the fabricator:
- [corne-eclipse-plates.zip](/fabrication/!for-fabricator-production/corne-eclipse-plates.zip)

### Shield Case

![Shield](/assets/images/corne-eclipse-shield.png)

Provide these files to the fabricator:
- [corne-eclipse-shield-left.stl](/fabrication/!for-fabricator-production/corne-eclipse-shield-left.stl)
- [corne-eclipse-shield-right.stl](/fabrication/!for-fabricator-production/corne-eclipse-shield-right.stl)

*Note: Some fabricators have gotten pretty good at printing this out in metal.*
