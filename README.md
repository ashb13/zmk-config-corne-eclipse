- Native support for tenting puck

## Peripheral-side Trackpad Support

- TPS43 (and related Azoteq IQS5xx modules) via [AYM1607/zmk-driver-azoteq-iqs5xx](https://github.com/AYM1607/zmk-driver-azoteq-iqs5xx)
- Cirque Touchpad via [petejohanson/cirque-input-module](https://github.com/petejohanson/cirque-input-module)

## ZMK Modifications

### External Display Upgrades

- Lithium curve LUT applied for a 403450 to get more accurate numeric charge data (PR reference: [ZMK PR 2066](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/pull/2066))

### RGB Battery Optimizations

Powered by [zmk-ext-power-smart-idle](https://github.com/Frosthaven/zmk-ext-power-smart-idle).

- 20% brightness when not plugged in
- RGB auto-off on low battery when not plugged in
- Lights stay on when plugged in
- Eclipse v3 reversible variant uses a MOSFET that prevents drain when LEDs are off (coming soon)
